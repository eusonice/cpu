# CS61CPU

Look ma, I made a CPU! Here's what I did:

For this project I built a CPU that runs the RISC-V instructions I learned during the first part of the semester. The CPU has 5 stages in a big picture, Instruction Fetch, Instructino Decode/Register Read, ALU Execute, Memory Access, and Write Back, and I had to make these work on my CPU. This project helped me a lot on solidifying my understanding on RISC-V instructions and build logic gates. I thought RISC-V and logic gates/building circuits were pretty straightforward concepts individually but combining the two and implementing into an actual CPU was pretty hard. However I enjoyed a lot doing this project and I think I learned a lot. Debugging method was hard to understand just by reading the spec but office hours were helpful.
